# Eindhoven chapter of Papers We ‚ù§

This is the repository for the Eindhoven chapter of Papers We Love.

Do you want to talk about a recent paper that you are excited about? Do you
want to explain fundamental papers of your field to a wider audience?  Do you
want to (re-)discover important research works in computer science? Do you have
this really cool paper you want to tell us about?  Present the papers that you
love, tell us about how you've implement them and use them, or simply listen
and discuss!

We're curating this repository for papers presented at PWL Eindhoven. You can
contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories,
like the _main_ Papers We Love repo,
[here](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love).

We follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

We keep a [list of papers that we would like to talk about](paper_ideas.md).
Send us pull requests to add your own!
